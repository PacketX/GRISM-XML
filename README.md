## A Simple GRISM XML

Define filter id=1 aka **F1** as black IP list and descript network topology in chain. When packets come from P0, if matched F1, send to P1, else if not matched, send to P2

```xml
<run>
    <filter id="1" name="black IP list">
        <or>
            <find name="ip.addr" relation="==" content="92.53.120.155" />
            <find name="ip.addr" relation="==" content="67.229.164.135" />
            <find name="ip.addr" relation="==" content="159.203.92.222" />            
        </or>
    </filter>
    <chain>
        <in>P0</in>
        <fid>F1</fid>
        <out>P1</out>
        <next type="notmatch">
